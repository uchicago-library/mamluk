  <!-- BEGIN WEB AUTHOR CONTENT CODE -->
<ul>
<li>On this page, {} are used to denote the contents of an input box on the 
	search page. <br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>A boolean<b> and</b> is implicit between terms in an input box. Do not type 
	it, or it will be included in the search. Only records which contain all of 
	the terms in an input box will be found. Typing <b>and</b> will find only 
	records which contain the word <i>and</i> along with the other terms in your 
	search. This is an obvious problem, as Arabic names and titles are unlikely 
	to contain <i>and. And</i> does, however, often appear in records with multiple 
	editors or multiple translations.<br>
	<br>
	<u>Examples:</u> Searching for<b> </b>{<b>al-busiri</b>}<b> </b>will find 
	records for both <i>al-Busiri, Sharaf al-Din Muhammad ibn Sa`id</i> and <i>al-Busiri, 
	Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Abi Bakr al-Shafi`i</i>. Searching for {<b>al-busiri 
	sharaf</b>},<b> </b>{<b>sharaf al-busiri</b>}, {<b>sharaf busiri</b>} and 
	{<b>busiri sharaf</b>} will find records for only the former. While {<b>"busiri 
	and sharaf"</b>} does not find any records, {<b>busiri and sharaf</b>} 
	finds several, because of phrases like <i>edited and translated by</i> or 
	<i>Arabic text with Urdu translation and notes.</i><br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>Do not use apostrophes, accents, 'ayns, or hamzas in search terms. Do not 
	use diacritics. <br>
	Apostrophes and accents are ignored. Thus, the searches {<b>al-`asqalani</b>}, 
	{<b>al-asqalani</b>}, {<b>asqalani</b>}, and {<b>`asqalani</b>} are treated 
	identically and yield identical results.<br>
	<br>
	Generally, <i>al-</i> (a, l, hyphen) can be omitted (except from phrase searches) 
	because the search software ignores <i>al-</i> when it is at the <u>beginning</u> 
	of a word. Thus, the searches {<b>al-rahman</b>} and {<b>rahman</b>} are treated 
	identically.<br>
	The software does not, however, ignore <i>al</i> when it stands alone without 
	a hyphen. In the search {<b>al rahman</b>}, the two words <i>(al &amp; rahman)</i> 
	are joined by the implicit<b> and</b>, so all records containing the word 
	<i>al </i>(not <i>al-</i>) and the word <i>rahman</i> will be found. The search 
	{<b>al-rahman</b>} gets over 500 more hits than the search {<b>al rahman</b>}, 
	because the latter needs both words to exist, while the former drops the <i>al-.</i><br>
	<br>
	In phrase searches, all characters must appear exactly as they appear in records. 
	For example, {<b>"Ibn al-`Arabi"</b>} will find most records for this individual, 
	but will not find the few in which his name is presented as <i>Ibn `Arabi.</i> 
	The search {<b>"ibn arabi"</b>} will retrieve no records. 
  The best solution is to begin by searching a discrete part of a name--like {<b>arabi</b>}. <br>
  <br></li>
<li>You can search an entire phrase by using quotation marks. This allows for 
	a more focused search. <br>
	For example, {<b>"ahmad ibn ibrahim"</b>} will find only the few 
	records containing that exact phrase, while {<b>ahmad ibn ibrahim</b>} will 
	find any records with all three terms in them somewhere, whether the terms 
	are adjacent or not.<br>
	<br>
	Keep in mind that the terms in quotes must appear in exactly the same order 
	and form in a record or they will not be found. Searching for {<b>"ahmad 
	ibn ibrahim"</b>} will not find records for <i> Burhan al-Din Abu Ishaq 
	Ibrahim ibn Ahmad al-Dimashqi al-Tanukhi.</i><br>
	<br>
	A phrase search and another term or terms in the same box are joined by the 
	implict <b>and</b>, allowing for an even more focused search. For example 
	{<b>"ahmad ibn ibrahim" rashid</b>} will find only one record, in which <i>Rashid</i> 
	is part of the editor's name. <br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>Phrase searches are particularly useful when searching for names or titles 
	that are quite common. <i>Muhammad, ibn, </i>and<i> Yusuf</i><b> </b>are all 
	common terms. Searching {<b>muhammad ibn yusuf</b>} will find hundreds of 
	records, some of which do not contain the name <i>Muhammad ibn Yusuf. Muhammad 
	ibn</i> might be in the author's name, and <i>Yusuf</i> might be in the name 
	of the editor or translator. A search for {<b>"muhammad ibn yusuf"</b>} 
	will yield far fewer records, and the opposite, {<b>"yusuf ibn muhammad"</b>}, 
	will find entirely different records.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>In the event that you are unsure of a spelling, you may use more than one 
	input box. For example, in the first box you might type {<b>"muhammad 
	ibn yusuf"</b>} and in the second you might type {<b>"mohammed ibn 
	yusuf"</b>}. In general, Arabic names are entered in this bibliography 
	as they appear in Library of Congress authority files. Thus, <i>Muhammad</i> 
	will almost always be the correct option, unless an editor or some other modern 
	person has become established under a different spelling. The use of the <b>or</b> 
	function is more useful for European authors in the primary bibliography, 
	as their names might be variously recorded in Latin, German, Italian, Spanish 
	or other forms (<i>Paul de Guglingen Walther </i>is also known as <i>Paulus 
	Guglingensis,</i> for example). In such cases, records usually indicate alternate 
	spellings in a note.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>Wildcards (% and _) may be used freely.<br>
	<br>
	<b> %</b> matches any string of one or more characters. The search 
	{<b>ab%c</b>} will hit on terms like <i>`abdc, `abbasic, </i>and<i> abuc. </i>On 
	the other hand, {<b>c%ab</b>} will find <i>ckitab, c`arab, cShihab, </i>etc. Finally, 
	{<b>a%b</b>} finds such terms as <i>Ahdab, Ashab,</i> and <i>`Azab.</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>_</b> The underscore matches a single character only. Thus {<b>ab_</b>} 
	will find <i>abu</i> but not <i>`abbasi</i>. It may be used in any position 
	in the word.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>For purposes of searching, all characters with accents, umlauts, diacritics 
	and other additional marks are treated just like the raw character. Thus, 
	to find a title with <i>Selçuklular</i> or <i>Selçuklularla</i> 
	in it, simply search {<b>selcuklular*</b>}. To find the German word <i>auszüge,</i> 
	search {<b>auszuge</b>}. This has several advantages. First, it allows any 
	user to search any word or name without worrying about entering such characters. 
	Second, it means that the term will be found wherever it exists, even if in 
	some cases the accent or other mark is missing. There are, for example, records 
	in which <i>auszüge</i> lacks the umlaut, and there are instances where 
	a name might appear under multiple spellings, such as <i>Niccoló, Niccolò 
	and Niccolo, </i>or<i> Khaldûn </i>and<i> Khaldun.</i> There are also 
	instances of the spelling <i>Khaldoun</i> in titles, so it would be most effective 
	to search {<b>khald*</b>}. If you know that such variations exist in the spelling 
	of a name or word, try a search with wildcards, as it might find more records.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>Modern authors, editors, and translators are not displayed in the primary 
	bibliography's author browse list. They may be found via the author search.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>The order of words within an input box does not affect the search, except, 
	obviously, when the words are a phrase in quotation marks.<br>
	<br>
  </li>
<li>Please feel free to email <a href="mailto:mideast-library@uchicago.edu">MEDOC</a> 
	with comments or questions about the bibliographies or this help page. Please 
	put Mamluk Bibliography in the subject line of your email. As with any publically 
	available resource, there are certain to be aspects of this database that 
	will only become apparent through sustained use. We have tested this resource 
	carefully, but we could not try every imaginable search. Our primary goal 
	is the creation of a genuinely useful resource for scholarship, and we welcome 
	your input. Please be aware that there are features still in development. 
	Also, we are aware that there are many thousands of sources still not listed 
	in either of these bibliographies. Our databases are growing every day. We 
	have decided to make this available at this point not because it is truly 
	comprehensive, but because it has reached a size at which it may be of use 
	to others, and because keeping it to ourselves would serve no one. </li>
